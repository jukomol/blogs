In this blog post, I walk you through the design and development of a lightweight CCTV system using a regular webcam and a Flask-based Python web app. This application serves live video through a web browser, records hourly footage automatically, and lets you view and download those recordings with ease.

---

### üí° Key Features

* Live MJPEG stream from your webcam
* Automatic hourly recording with timestamped filenames
* Start and stop recording from the browser
* Explore saved recordings within the web interface
* Runs efficiently on Docker and compatible with Windows

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The app leverages Python‚Äôs threading to keep recording and streaming parallel. OpenCV handles camera input and frame encoding, while Flask powers the server and routes. I used a shared buffer protected by a lock to avoid conflicts between the stream and recorder.

---

### üìÅ Recording Directory

All videos are saved in `static/recordings`. Each file is encoded using **MP4V at 30 FPS** and stored as a separate hour-long segment.

---

### üß™ Challenges

* Proper threading to avoid deadlocks and broken feeds
* Ensuring clean start/stop toggling of the recording logic
* Docker compatibility and OpenCV camera device mapping

---

### üöÄ Dockerized Deployment

The app runs in a Docker container with access to `/dev/video0`. This makes it portable and easy to deploy on edge devices or remote systems.

---

### üì∑ My Setup

```
Host: TUF GAMING FX504GE
OS: Windows 10 + WSL 2 (Docker)
Camera: Built-in HD Webcam
Python: 3.11
Libraries: Flask, OpenCV
```
