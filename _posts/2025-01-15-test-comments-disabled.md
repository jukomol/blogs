This is a test post to verify that comments can be disabled on a per-post basis.

## Testing Comments Control

This post has `comments: false` in its front matter, so the Giscus comment section should not appear below this content.

## Key Features

- Individual post comment control
- Backward compatibility with existing posts
- Simple true/false flag in front matter

This functionality allows authors to selectively enable or disable comments on specific posts while maintaining the global comment settings.
