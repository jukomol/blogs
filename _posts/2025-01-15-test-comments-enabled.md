This is a test post to verify that comments can be explicitly enabled on a per-post basis.

## Testing Comments Control

This post has `comments: true` in its front matter, so the Giscus comment section should appear below this content.

## Key Features

- Individual post comment control
- Explicit enabling with `comments: true`
- Works alongside global comment settings

This demonstrates that you can explicitly enable comments on posts, providing full control over the comment functionality.
